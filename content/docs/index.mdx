### Real-time visual editing

* Create and edit content directly in the context of your website or application with Tina's real-time visual editor.
* Customizable content blocks allow content editors to assemble pages and manage content intuitively, similar to using a site builder.
* The changes made by the editors can be previewed in real-time before publishing, ensuring the quality of the content.

### Control over content

* Tina's open-source model gives you complete control and ownership over your content.
* Tina's (optional) self-hosted backend gives you piece of mind from vendor lock-in.
