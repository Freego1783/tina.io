## Introduction

This guide is a walkthrough using a **WordPress to Markdown converter**, which is recommended for most use cases.

Other conversion options that are not covered in this guide include:

* Rest API to JSON - best for extracting the pure html for pages or posts
* Using the WPGraphQL plugin - best for cases where you want to extract specific pages or posts

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed
* You have set up a [Tina starter](https://tina.io/docs/introduction/using-starter)

## Getting Started

1. Export your Wordpress content by going to [https://wordpress.com/export/](https://wordpress.com/export/) and select **Export All**

Note: Name it export.xml to make it easier for you in the next step

Begin by [exporting your WordPress content](https://wordpress.com/export) and **Export All**, save it as export.xml.

Next, we'll be using [wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) to convert your WordPress content into Markdown.

From the directory that you saved export.xml, run:

```powershell
npx wordpress-export-to-markdown --post-folders=false --include-other-types=true
```

Use the defaults for the other prompts, this will group our posts together and also include pages in the output.

## Migrating your content

Now you have your pages and posts in Markdown format, we'll have to make some small changes to work with Tina.

### Migrating images

In the output folder where your posts are, drag the image folder to your Tina app's `public/uploads` folder.

You can also set up alternative hosting.

### Migrating Posts

Drag all the Markdown files to your Tina app's `content/posts` folder, now your posts have been migrated to Tina!

*(Optional) -* If you want to take advantage of what MDX files offer, you can convert them easily:

```powershell
ren * *.mdx
```

### Migrating Pages
